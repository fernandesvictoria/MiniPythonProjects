- User-defined range for the random number
- Input validation for guesses
- Feedback on guesses (too high/too low)
- Counts and displays the number of attempts

### 5. Password Manager
A secure password management system that allows users to store and retrieve their passwords. Passwords are encrypted using the `cryptography` library, ensuring that sensitive information is kept safe.

**Key Features:**
- Ability to add and view passwords
- Passwords are encrypted for security
- Simple command-line interface for interaction
